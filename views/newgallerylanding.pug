      p I'm finding new inspiration every day, chances to learn from and work with other creatives.  Photography is so much more than clicking a shutter at the right time. For me, it's creating a mood and telling a story through a lens.  
        |My gallery features some of the more memorable images that I've captured.  
        |As I discover new subjects and creative opportunities, my portfolio will continue to evolve and present a cross-section of my best work.
