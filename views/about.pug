          p My name is Danny Solis. Thank you, for taking the time to visit my portfolio site. 
          p I'm a husband, technologist, pet rescue advocate, and photographer. My world is comprised of a wonderful wife and two spoiled rotten Shih Tzus. We live, laugh, and love in Austin, TX.
          p I created <a href="/">march76.com</a> to showcase my work and share stories from my creative ventures.
            |  I also founded a site, called <a href="https://totespets.com">totespets.com</a>, centered around the topic of pet rescue and adoption.

          p Photography has been a passion of mine, since I was a teenager. I started shooting with film on a Pentax PZ10, learning proper exposure, focus, and composition.
            |  Technology has come a long way since then, but the craft remains the same. My hope is that this site will journal my pursuit of interesting images that are sharp and well-composed. 
          p My <a href="/blog">blog</a> is a collection of photo stories and personal thoughts on the art of photography.

          p I'm finding new inspiration every day, chances to learn from and work with other creatives. 
            |  Photography is so much more than clicking a shutter at the right time. For me, it's creating a mood and telling a story through a lens. 
          p My <a href="/gallery">gallery</a> features some of the more memorable images that I've captured.
            |  As I discover new subjects and creative opportunities, my portfolio will continue to evolve and present a cross-section of my best work.
