      h4#get-started-faq FAQ
      p How much does a photo shoot cost?
      p Do you share my photos online or use them for other promotional purposes?
      ul
        li Never without your consent.  As the original photographer, I do retain the copyright for all my images. However, your privacy matters and I would not think of sharing your photos online or using as stock images without a signed release from you.  
          |Psst - I do offer a discount for allowing me to share your images in my portfolio.  Just ask!
      p Do you capture other types of photos - boudoir, cosplay, architecture?
